- **Advanced Search**: Customize your property search by type (rent/sale), amenities, sorting options, and more.

- **User Profiles**: Registered users can create and manage their profiles with profile pictures and listings also.

- **Authentication**: Secure user registration and login functionality with Google OAuth.
